## Development
- Precondition:  
    node version must be greater than v16  
    cypress must be installed `npm install cypress@12.5 --save-dev`
- Project uses NPM as package manager, to install dependencies run `npm install`
- If version of cypress 12.5 is not installed with `npm install`, manual way to do it is to run `npm install cypress@12.5 --save-dev`
- To run tests with testrunner, execute `npx cypress open`
- To run tests in headless mode, execute `npx cypress run`
